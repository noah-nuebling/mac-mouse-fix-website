            "trackpad.gestures.disclaimer": "Note: Mac Mouse Fix can bring these Trackpad features to your third-party mouse as described here, only if your mouse has at least 5 buttons. These 5 buttons are typically left-click, right-click, mouse-wheel click, and 2 side-buttons. If your mouse has fewer than 5 buttons, Mac Mouse Fix still provides rich functionality and a great experience, but some features will be less easy to access compared to a 5-button mouse. On certain mice designed to be used with proprietary driver software like Logitech Options, Mac Mouse Fix can't recognize all the buttons at the moment.
